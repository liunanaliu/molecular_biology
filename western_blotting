a technique to detect a specific protein in a protein mixture
quantify the protein via BCA assay

###########################################################
step 1: SDS-PAGE migrate from the negative charge (black side) to the positive charge (red side) due to itself negative charge
wash the gel with dd h2o for 5 mintues, for 3 time, hold on transfer buffer
difference parameters for upper nd lower layers for gel

step 2: transfer protein to a nitrocellulose membrane
immerse the materials for sandwich in the transfer buffer for 10 minutes, but for the mmembrane firstly in menthol
start from the negative black side, firstly for teh gel, next for the membrane
ass long as the gel and membrane contact, do not move, label for the contactedd side, do not have bubbles in between
the side contacted with the gel stands up forever.

step 3: blocking
no need to wash?

step 4: primary antibody, monoclonal mouse
whsh 10 minters with tbst buffer, for 3 times, 

step 5: secondary antbody, species-specific, rabbit anti-mouse. with horse radish peroxidase (HPR)
attached which will catalyse the reaction of luminol
