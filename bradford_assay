coomassie brilliant blue G-250 + protein -(with acidic soltuion) 
- shift of absorption maximun from 470 nm to 595 nm
how to determine protein concentration

#related to optical density at different concentration, similar to BCA assay
#advantage - fast & easy, sensitive, 
#disadvantage - incompatibility with detergents


##############################################################
BCA assay
advantage compared to bradford assay
compatible with surfactants (detergents) up to 5%
independent on amino acid composition
#step1 - preparing the working solution, 
carbonate buffer with BCA at pH 11 * cupric-sulfate solution at 50:1 to make the working solution
#step2 - protein sample and BSA standard
BSa standard including serial dilution of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 ug/uL
#step3 - incubation of samples + reagent for 30 min at 37 degrees
#step4 - analysis at end point measurement absorbance at 562 nm
make standard curve, and calculate the contentration of interest


reaction mechanism
##step1 - protein + Cu2+ -----(OH-) = Cu1+
the amount of Cu2+ reduced is proportional to the amount of protein, 
the standard without any protein is green, wherase the highest concentraion of protein is dark purple
##step2 - 2 BCA molecules chelate with Cu1+
