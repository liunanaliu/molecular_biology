difference to get the serum and plasma

Serum is the liquid that remains after the blood has clotted.
Plasma is the liquid that remains when clotting is prevented with the addition of an anticoagulant.

whole blood consists of 55% plasma, and 45% formedd elements, (including 60 - 70% neutrophils, 20 - 25% lymphocytes, 
3 - 8% monocytes, )

whole blood preparation

1. collect whole blood into heparinized tubes or into the tubes containing 1 uL 10% potassium EDTA per 100 uL of whole blood,
2. aliquot 100 uL unlysed whole blood into a 12 x 75 mm round-bottom tubes, or 2 Ml microcentrifuge tube, (to maximum the reaction area)
or 50 uL of whole blood, 
could blocking Fc-receptor firstly, for all the blood, then divide them eqaully, 
but must make sure the amount of cells in 1mL, namely concentrtion.

cell surface staining

1. prepare desired antibody cocktails, protect from light, and pay attention to the reaction temperature
50 uL added in 100 uL whole blood, so the antobodies should be connsidered for 3-fold, namely in 3x working concentration
the final concentration is for 150 uL, not for 50 uL

2. add the non-specific Fc block receptor, namely CD16/32 for mouse (optimal???) and wash

3. add the cocktail of antobodies, and mix by pipetting, incubate the samples in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes,
or inncubate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at 2-8 degrees with rotation, protect from light,

4. top up 2 mL (for 100 uL of whole blood, add 2 mL of RT 1x 1-step fix/lyse solution), invert gently
incubate for 10 to 60 minutes at RT, away from light with intermittent inversion,
this step is for RBC lysis as well as fixation of whole blood cells,
Viability dyes may not be used on cells lysed using the 1-Step Fix/Lyse Solution as fixation can cause 
permeabilization of the cells.

5. spin down at 2000 rpm / 400 - 600 g for 10 minutes at 4 degrees,

6. aspirate supernatant, wash pellet with 2 mL FACS buffer, repeat step 4!

7. aspirate supernatant, and resuspend in 240 uL of FACS buffer, 

8. filter cells at RT through 0.45 um cell strainer to remove large debris and ensure single cell suspension, run flow.
