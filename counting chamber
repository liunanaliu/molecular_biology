one square is about 0.1 mm3 (1mm * 1mm * 0.1 mm), which equals 0.1 uL
consider dilute 1:9 for 10-fold dilution, 
how many cells per mL?
usually the applied volume is 10 microliter, namely, 10 uL
1 mL = 0.1 uL * factor, 
factor = 10**4
cells in one square, mainly in the center with 25 cells in total, 
* factor
* dilution factor
